Final Project :

Implement the following classifiers, train using the training set, and 
report the error rates on the test set. The training set and the test set are given
in IMOX.txt.

1) Bayesian Classifier (Assuming Gaussian distribution)

2) kNN (k=1, 3, 5)

3) 3-layer Neural Network Classifier (structure : 8-10-4)

4) SVM(Support Vector Machine)

5) k-means clustering (# of clusters = 4, class label is unknown.)

* Data can be your own data of reasonable size with multiple classes > 2.
* You may use any toolbox, library, or source code for the above classifier's implementation.
  Ex.) SVM : SVMlight, libSVM
